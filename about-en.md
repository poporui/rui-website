I was born and raised in Beijing, majoring in marketing — but I hated it. One morning in 2019, over breakfast, [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain/videos) changed my life. [Daniel Shiffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman) was live-coding with joy and chaos. Something cracked open. I started teaching myself front-end, JavaScript, and UI/UX design — not to become a developer, but to give shape to my curiosity.

The more I learned, the more I realized: tools are just tools. It is the question that matters.
“What if rice could grow in the Saudi desert?”  
“What if blind people could date without relying on visuals?”  
“What if you could preserve and visualize your dreams?”

2020, a crazy time in life. I researched and built prototypes for all of those ideas — from web, app, robotic to system design. On the side note, those experiements gave me a ticket to grad school at NYU - where Daniel teaches.

2021 COVID hit, left me little else to do, I joined [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) as a product manager. Indeed it was a huge jump, from ideological to hyper-quantified. I learned how to ship products used by billions — from researching, delivering prototypes, syncing with devs, optimizing AB tests, scaling metrics, and leveraging AI Labs capabilities. It was a truly elite team, but I also realized: Being a tiny gadget in a massive machine is not what i wanted.

When a more concrete idea came to me, I co-founded AhaClub, a job consulting app with 20K paid users in six months. But soon after COVID ends, I turned down a funding offer and moved to New York. AhaClub is still running, but I wanted to see what was waiting on the other side of the world.

Turns out, it was blockchain.

People called it a bubble— I decided to hold back judgment until I see the full picture. That mindset led me to become a full-time investor after graduating in 2023. It wasn’t part of the plan, but turned out to be the fastest way to learn.

Crypto has already proven itself: first as a new form of money— ask MicroStrategy or BlackRock. Then as a parallel financial system. And future, as the foundation for the next internet- decentralization and ownership might not matter until they do. Working in this space has taught me how capital allocates, how to reconcile short-term survival with long-term conviction. By no means is it easy, especially when speculation, macro shifts, and micro cycles constantly test your resolve.

Still, I’d rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.

We're in a world that is undergoing some visible, predictable, and interesting changes, including the reshuffling of monetary, political, and geopolitical orders, and the redefinition of productivity and labor by AI, quantum computing, and robotics. My journey is still going on.
