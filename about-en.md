I was born and raised in Beijing, majoring in marketing - but it never felt right. One morning in 2018, over breakfast, [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain/videos) changed my life. [Daniel Shiffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman) was live-coding with pure joy and chaos. Something cracked open. I started teaching myself front-end, JavaScript, and UI/UX design — not to become a developer, but to give shape to my curiosity.



The more I learned, the more I realized: tools are just tools. It's the questions that move the world.

“What if rice could grow in the Saudi desert?”  
“What if the visually impaired could date without ever swiping left?”  
“What if you could preserve and share your dreams?”

2020 was a crazy time. I built prototypes for all those ideas — from web apps to robotics to full system designs. As a side effect, those experiments also got me into grad school at NYU, where Daniel teaches.

COVID left little else to do, so I joined [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) as a product manager in 2021. It was a massive jump — from poetic prototyping to hyper-quantified growth loops. I learned how to ship products used by billions: researching, prototyping, syncing with devs, optimizing AB tests, scaling metrics, and tapping into AI Labs’ capabilities. It was an elite team — but I also realized: being a tiny gadget inside a giant machine wasn’t what I want.

When the right idea hit, I co-founded [AhaClub](https://sj.qq.com/appdetail/wxd837edeb52a82b5c), a job consulting app that reached 20,000 paid users within six months in China. We moved fast, we broke things, we built a real business. But when COVID ended, I turned down funding and moved to New York in 2022. AhaClub is still running — but I wanted to see what was waiting on the other side of the world.

Turns out, it was crypto and blockchain.

People called it a bubble— maybe, but I don’t laugh at things I don’t fully understand. That mindset eventually led me to become a full-time investor after graduating in 2023. It wasn’t part of the plan, but it turned out to be the fastest way to learn.

Crypto has already proven itself: first as a new form of money— ask [MicroStrategy](https://www.strategy.com/) or [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust-etf). Then, as a parallel financial system. And future, as the foundation for the next internet, decentralization and ownership might not matter until they do. Working in the space has taught me how capital allocates and how to reconcile short-term survival with long-term conviction. By no means is it easy, especially when speculation, macro shifts, and micro cycles constantly test your resolve.

Still, I’d rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.

We’re living through visible, predictable, and fascinating changes — the reshuffling of monetary, political, and geopolitical orders, and the redefinition of productivity and labor through AI, quantum computing, and robotics. My journey is still unfolding.
